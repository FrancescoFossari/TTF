# TTF
This application developed in Swift and swiftUI, allows users to challenge each other in an activity competition where whoever gets the most points in a specific competition climbs the leaderboard, obtaining more points. The application uses Machine Learning to recognize movements and assign points. It is a fully functional prototype with only a few executable exercises. It is also possible to create an extension, such as adding more physical exercises or implementing other game modes.
